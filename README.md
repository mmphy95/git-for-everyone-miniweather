# Introduction

The miniWeather code mimics the basic dynamics seen in atmospheric weather and
climate. The dynamics themselves are dry compressible, stratified,
non-hydrostatic flows dominated by buoyant forces that are relatively small
perturbations on a hydrostatic background state. The equations in this code
themselves form the backbone of pretty much all fluid dynamics codes, and this
particular flavor forms the base of all weather and climate modeling.

With about 500 total lines of code (and only about 200 lines that you care
about), it serves as an approachable place to learn parallelization and porting
using MPI + X, where X is OpenMP, OpenACC, CUDA, or potentially other
approaches to CPU and accelerated parallelization. The code uses periodic
boundary conditions in the x-direction and solid wall boundary conditions in
the z-direction. 

# Compiling and Running the Code

## Software Dependencies

* Parallel-netcdf: https://github.com/Parallel-NetCDF/PnetCDF
  * This is a dependency for two reasons: (1) NetCDF files are easy to visualize and convenient to work with; (2) The users of this code shouldn't have to write their own parallel I/O.
* Ncview: http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html
  * This is the easiest way to visualize NetCDF files.
* MPI
* For OpenACC: An OpenACC-capable compiler (PGI / Nvidia, Cray, GNU)
  * A free version of the PGI / Nvidia compiler can be obtained by googling for the "Community Edition"
* For OpenMP: An OpenMP offload capable compiler (Cray, XL, GNU)
* CMake: https://cmake.org

## Basic Setup

```shell
git clone git@github.com:jfdev001/miniWeather.git 
cd miniWeather
```

To find that repository on GitHub, go to  

```text
https://github.com/jfdev001/miniWeather
```

and star it so that you can easily find it later.

If you prefer, you can fork (see [github docs: fork a
repo](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo))
that repo and then clone your own fork of `miniweather`. This is also a good
approach since then you can upload (i.e., `git push`) your code to a repository
on your GitHub. The workflow would look something like the following

```shell
# assuming you have forked miniweather
git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/miniWeather.git 
cd miniWeather

# by default, the remote origin (i.e., source of your code on GitHub
# and its destination when pushing) is set to 
# git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USER_NAME_HERE/miniWeather.git ...
# by adding another remote and calling it upstream, you can at any
# time inspect or pull the code provided by jfdev001 without breaking
# you local changes 
git remote add upstream git@github.com:jfdev001/miniWeather.git 
git fetch upstream  # allows you to pull code from jfdev001 in the future
```

## Building and Testing Workflow

The first thing you should do is verify that you can compile and run
`miniweather`. Note, you don't actually need to do that for the Git workshop;
however, if you would like to, you can use the provided Docker image (assuming
Docker is installed on your system):

```shell
sudo docker pull jfdev001/miniweather:local
docker run -v $(realpath ./):/workspace/miniweather -it jfdev001/miniweather:local
```

Then, make sure that you are in the `build/` directory and do:

```shell
# TODO: something here?? maybe a TEST??
```

This generates a directory called `build_output/test` where all configuration
(e.g., auto-generated Makefiles) and compilation artifacts (e.g., executable
binaries like `serial`, `openmp`, and `mpi`) are stored.

You should *always* read the usage documentation for any script you run. For
nearly every script provided, you can do the following to get usage
documentation

```shell
# assuming you're in the directory of the script...
# also if you encounter permissions issues, call `chmod +x <script_name>`
./<script_name> -h
```

## Altering the Code's Configurations

To alter the configuration of the code, you can control the number of cells in
the x- and z-directions, the length of simulation time, the output frequency,
and the initial data to use by calling `cmake_levante_build_and_configure`,
see 

```shell
# assuming in build/ dir
./cmake_levante_build_and_configure -h
```

This script forwards arguments to two calls to `cmake` that configure and build
the script. The generated `cmake` configuration call might look like the below:

* `-DNX=400`: Uses 400 cells in the x-direction
* `-DNZ=200`: Uses 200 cells in the z-direction
* `-DSIM_TIME=1000`: Simulates for 1,000 seconds model time
* `-DOUT_FREQ=10`: Outputs every 10 seconds model time
* `-DDATA_SPEC=DATA_SPEC_THERMAL`: Initializes a rising thermal

It's best if you keep `NX` exactly twice the value of `NZ` since the domain is
20km x 10km. 

The data specifications are `DATA_SPEC_COLLISION`, `DATA_SPEC_THERMAL`,
`DATA_SPEC_MOUNTAIN`, `DATA_SPEC_DENSITY_CURRENT`, and `DATA_SPEC_INJECTION`,
and each are described later on.

## Running the Code

It is recommended to run the `build_output/test/serial_test` code first to get
an idea for the model outputs. Note that a file `output.nc` is always produced 
in the directory from which you call the `miniweather` executables.

As an example:

```shell
# assuming in fortran/ directory... this produces `output.nc` there
./build/build_output/test/serial_test
```

Since parameters are set in the code itself, you don't need to pass any
parameters to the executables.

This is fine for testing lightweight serial codes; however, we are interested
in parallel codes. Since you are using a compute cluster shared by many people,
jobs requiring more computational resources must be submitted to the Slurm
scheduler.

We provide a script that wraps the generation of a run script which you can
use later for running simulations. You can check out the parameters for this
script here:

```shell
./scripts/templates/make_run_scripts -h
```

This script can be used to generate Slurm scripts specific to your user for
running `miniweather` simulations. These scripts are, by convention, written to
`scripts/run` and are *not* tracked by `git`. If you wish to modify the
`.gitignore` file and remove the line containing `*.run`, `git` will not track
your generated run scripts. The run scripts will also be prefixed with the
partition that you have requested. Different partitions on levante (e.g.,
shared, compute, gpu) give the user differ compute resources. By default the
compute partition is used, and this will work with MPI and OpenMP jobs.

You should generate an example run script with the following:

```shell
EMAIL_HERE="put_your_email@gmail.com"
./scripts/templates/make_run_scripts ${EMAIL_HERE}
```

This generates `scripts/run/compute_miniweather.run`. You should inspect what
this script does with

```shell
scripts/run/compute_miniweather.run -h
```

In particular, you should run each of the `bash` examples in the usage doc to
get an understanding of what *would* be submitted to Slurm. There are lots of
outputs so make sure to read and understand them. When ready to submit jobs to
Slurm, look at the `sbatch` examples in the same usage doc.

Note that the `time` sbatch directive is set to 30 seconds. This is sufficient
for running tests, but may not be sufficient for running larger scale
simulations. If your simulation significantly exceeds the amount of time
allocated by the `time` directive, the simulation will timeout and you the
outputs to `output.nc` may be incomplete. Be aware that increasing the amount
of time you would like to run your job may result in you waiting longer for
the Slurm scheduler to actually launch your job. You should always prototype
any experiments or scripts that you write which involve Slurm such that they
request a very short amount of time (i.e., less than 1 minute).

## Running Performance Experiments

You may want to evaluate how the performance of `miniweather` is affected by
increasing the number of threads, increasing the number of MPI processes, or
doing a combination of both. You can inspect a sample bash script that prepares
and launches such experiments:

```shell
./scripts/scaling/launch_sample_scaling_experiments -h
```

You can use that script as a template for running your own experiments.

## Visualizing Performance Results

This will also depend heavily on the types of experiments that you wish to run,
however, an example python code that can be launched by:

```shell
python scripts/viz/sample_scaling_results.py
```

That script has no `-h` option supported; however, at the top of the file
is a small description of the contents of the script itself and what it's for.

You copy/modify it to accomplish your plotting goals for your experiments.

Below is an example output from the script:

<img width="999" height="799" alt="miniweather_openmp" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f2959bf-393a-4ae2-8008-67383dffcc01" />

## Viewing the Output

The file I/O is done in the netCDF format: (https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf). To me, the easiest way to view the data is to use a tool called “ncview” (http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview_home_page.html). To use it, you can simply type `ncview output.nc`, making sure you have X-forwarding enabled in your ssh session. Further, you can call `ncview -frames output.nc`, and it will dump out all of your frames in the native resolution you're viewing the data in, and you you can render a movie with tools like `ffmpeg`. 

# Numerical Experiments

A number of numerical experiments are in the code for you to play around with. You can set these by changing the `data_spec_int` variable. 

## Rising Thermal

```
data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_THERML
sim_time = 1000
```

This simulates a rising thermal in a neutral atmosphere, which will look something like a “mushroom” cloud (without all of the violence).

Potential Temperature after 500 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/thermal_pt_0500.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 1,000 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/thermal_pt_1000.png" width=400/>

## Colliding Thermals

```
data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_COLLISION
sim_time = 700
```

This is similar to the rising thermal test case except with a cold bubble at the model top colliding with a warm bubble at the model bottom to produce some cool looking eddies.

Potential Temperature after 200 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/collision_pt_0200.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 400 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/collision_pt_0400.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 700 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/collision_pt_0700.png" width=400/>

## Mountain Gravity Waves

```
data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_MOUNTAIN
sim_time = 1500
```

This test cases passes a horizontal wind over a faked mountain at the model bottom in a stable atmosphere to generate a train of stationary gravity waves across the model domain.

Potential Temperature after 400 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/mountain_pt_0400.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 1,300 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/mountain_pt_1300.png" width=400/>

## Density Current

```
data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_DENSITY_CURRENT
sim_time = 600
```

This test case creates a neutrally stratified atmosphere with a strong cold bubble in the middle of the domain that crashes into the ground to give the feel of a weather front (more of a downburst, I suppose).

Potential Temperature after 200 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/density_current_pt_0200.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 600 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/density_current_pt_0600.png" width=400/>

## Injection

```
data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_INJECTION
sim_time = 1200
```

A narrow jet of fast and slightly cold wind is injected into a balanced, neutral atmosphere at rest from the left domain near the model top. This has nothing to do with atmospheric flows. It's just here for looks. 

Potential Temperature after 300 seconds:

<img src="https://github.com/mrnorman/miniWeather/blob/main/documentation/images/injection_pt_0300.png" width=400/>

Potential Temperature after 1,000 seconds:

# Physics, PDEs, and Numerical Approximations

While the numerical approximations in this code are certainly cheap and dirty, they are a fast and easy way to get the job done in a relatively small amount of code. For instance, on 16 K20x GPUs, you can perform a "colliding thermals” simulation with 5 million grid cells (3200 x 1600) in just a minute or two.

## The 2-D Euler Equations

This app simulates the 2-D inviscid Euler equations for stratified fluid dynamics, which are defined as follows:

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\rho" title="\large \rho" /> is density, u, and w are winds in the x-, and z-directions, respectively, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\theta" title="\large \theta" /> is potential temperature related to temperature, T, by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\theta=T\left(P_{0}/P\right)^{R_{d}/c_{p}}" title="\large \theta=T\left(P_{0}/P\right)^{R_{d}/c_{p}}" />,<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;P_{0}=10^{5}\,\text{Pa}" title="\large P_{0}=10^{5}\,\text{Pa}" /> is the surface pressure, g=9.8<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\text{\,\&space;m}\,\mbox{s}^{-2}" title="\large \text{\,\ m}\,\mbox{s}^{-2}" /> is acceleration due to gravity,<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;p=C_{0}\left(\rho\theta\right)^{\gamma}" title="\large p=C_{0}\left(\rho\theta\right)^{\gamma}" /> is the pressure as determined by an alternative form of the ideal gas equation of state,<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;C_{0}=R_{d}^{\gamma}p_{0}^{-R_{d}/c_{v}}" title="\large C_{0}=R_{d}^{\gamma}p_{0}^{-R_{d}/c_{v}}" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;R_{d}=287\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" title="\large R_{d}=287\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" /> is the dry gas constant, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\gamma=c_{p}/c_{v}" title="\large \gamma=c_{p}/c_{v}" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;c_{p}=1004\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" title="\large c_{p}=1004\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" /> is specific heat at constant pressure, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;c_{v}=717\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" title="\large c_{v}=717\,\mbox{J}\,\mbox{kg}^{-1}\,\mbox{K}^{-1}" /> is specific heat at constant volume. This can be cast in a more convenient form as:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial&space;t}&plus;\frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial&space;x}&plus;\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}}{\partial&space;z}=\mathbf{s}" title="\large \frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}}{\partial z}=\mathbf{s}" />

where a bold font represents a vector quantity.

## Maintaining Hydrostatic Balance

The flows this code simulates are relatively small perturbations off of a “hydrostatic” balance, which balances gravity with a difference in pressure:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\frac{dp}{dz}=-\rho&space;g" title="\large \frac{dp}{dz}=-\rho g" />

Because small violations of this balance lead to significant noise in the vertical momentum, it's best not to try to directly reconstruct this balance but rather to only reconstruct the perturbations. Therefore, hydrostasis is subtracted from the equations to give:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\frac{\partial}{\partial&space;t}\left[\begin{array}{c}&space;\rho^{\prime}\\&space;\rho&space;u\\&space;\rho&space;w\\&space;\left(\rho\theta\right)^{\prime}&space;\end{array}\right]&plus;\frac{\partial}{\partial&space;x}\left[\begin{array}{c}&space;\rho&space;u\\&space;\rho&space;u^{2}&plus;p\\&space;\rho&space;uw\\&space;\rho&space;u\theta&space;\end{array}\right]&plus;\frac{\partial}{\partial&space;z}\left[\begin{array}{c}&space;\rho&space;w\\&space;\rho&space;wu\\&space;\rho&space;w^{2}&plus;p^{\prime}\\&space;\rho&space;w\theta&space;\end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c}&space;0\\&space;0\\&space;-\rho^{\prime}g\\&space;0&space;\end{array}\right]" title="\large \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\begin{array}{c} \rho^{\prime}\\ \rho u\\ \rho w\\ \left(\rho\theta\right)^{\prime} \end{array}\right]+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[\begin{array}{c} \rho u\\ \rho u^{2}+p\\ \rho uw\\ \rho u\theta \end{array}\right]+\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left[\begin{array}{c} \rho w\\ \rho wu\\ \rho w^{2}+p^{\prime}\\ \rho w\theta \end{array}\right]=\left[\begin{array}{c} 0\\ 0\\ -\rho^{\prime}g\\ 0 \end{array}\right]" />

where a “prime” quantity represents that variable with the hydrostatic background state subtracted off (not a spatial derivative).

## Dimensional Splitting

This equation is solved using dimensional splitting for simplicity and speed. The equations are split into x- and z-direction solves that are, respectively:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;x:\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial&space;t}&plus;\frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial&space;x}=\mathbf{0}" title="\large x:\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{f}}{\partial x}=\mathbf{0}" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;z:\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial&space;t}&plus;\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}}{\partial&space;x}=\mathbf{s}" title="\large z:\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\,\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial\mathbf{h}}{\partial x}=\mathbf{s}" />

Each time step, the order in which the dimensions are solved is reversed, giving second-order accuracy overall. 

## Finite-Volume Spatial Discretization

A Finite-Volume discretization is used in which the PDE in a given dimension is integrated over a cell domain, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\Omega_{i}\in\left[x_{i-1/2},x_{i&plus;1/2}\right]" title="\large \Omega_{i}\in\left[x_{i-1/2},x_{i+1/2}\right]" />, where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;x_{i\pm1/2}=x_{i}\pm\Delta&space;x" title="\large x_{i\pm1/2}=x_{i}\pm\Delta x" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;x_{i}" title="\large x_{i}" /> is the cell center, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\Delta&space;x" title="\large \Delta x" /> is the width of the cell. The integration is the same in the z-direction. Using the Gauss divergence theorem, this turns the equation into (using the z-direction as an example):

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\frac{\partial\overline{\mathbf{q}}_{i,k}}{\partial&space;t}=-\frac{\mathbf{h}_{i,k&plus;1/2}-\mathbf{h}_{i,k-1/2}}{\Delta&space;z}&plus;\overline{\mathbf{s}}_{i,k}" title="\large \frac{\partial\overline{\mathbf{q}}_{i,k}}{\partial t}=-\frac{\mathbf{h}_{i,k+1/2}-\mathbf{h}_{i,k-1/2}}{\Delta z}+\overline{\mathbf{s}}_{i,k}" />

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\overline{\mathbf{q}}_{i,k}" title="\large \overline{\mathbf{q}}_{i,k}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\overline{\mathbf{s}}_{i,k}" title="\large \overline{\mathbf{s}}_{i,k}" /> are the cell-average of the fluid state and source term over the cell of index `i,k`.

To compute the update one needs the flux vector at the cell interfaces and the cell-averaged source term. To compute the flux vector at interfaces, fourth-order-accurate polynomial interpolation is used using the four cell averages surrounding the cell interface in question.

## Runge-Kutta Time Integration

So far the PDEs have been discretized in space but are still continuous in time. To integrate in time, we use a simple three-stage, linearly third-order-accurate Runge-Kutta integrator. It is solved as follows:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\mathbf{q}^{\star}=\mathbf{q}^{n}&plus;\frac{\Delta&space;t}{3}RHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{n}\right)" title="\large \mathbf{q}^{\star}=\mathbf{q}^{n}+\frac{\Delta t}{3}RHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{n}\right)" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\mathbf{q}^{\star\star}=\mathbf{q}^{n}&plus;\frac{\Delta&space;t}{2}RHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{\star}\right)" title="\large \mathbf{q}^{\star\star}=\mathbf{q}^{n}+\frac{\Delta t}{2}RHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{\star}\right)" />

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\mathbf{q}^{n&plus;1}=\mathbf{q}^{n}&plus;\Delta&space;tRHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{\star\star}\right)" title="\large \mathbf{q}^{n+1}=\mathbf{q}^{n}+\Delta tRHS\left(\mathbf{q}^{\star\star}\right)" />

When it comes to time step stability, I simply assume the maximum speed of propagation is 450\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}, which basically means that the maximum wind speed is assumed to be 100\,\text{m}\,\text{s}^{-1}, which is a safe assumption. I set the CFL value to 1.5 for this code.

## Hyper-viscosity

The centered fourth-order discretization is unstable for non-linear equations and requires extra dissipation to damp out small-wavelength energy that would otherwise blow up the simulation. This damping is accomplished with a scale-selective fourth-order so-called “hyper”-viscosity that is defined as:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial&space;t}&plus;\frac{\partial}{\partial&space;x}\left(-\kappa\frac{\partial^{3}\mathbf{q}}{\partial&space;x^{3}}\right)=\mathbf{0}" title="\large \frac{\partial\mathbf{q}}{\partial t}+\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(-\kappa\frac{\partial^{3}\mathbf{q}}{\partial x^{3}}\right)=\mathbf{0}" />

and this is also solved with the Finite-Volume method just like above. The hyperviscosity constant is defined as:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\kappa=-\beta\left(\Delta&space;x\right)^{4}2^{-4}\left(\Delta&space;t\right)^{-1}" title="\large \kappa=-\beta\left(\Delta x\right)^{4}2^{-4}\left(\Delta t\right)^{-1}" />

where <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\beta\in\left[0,1\right]" title="\large \beta\in\left[0,1\right]" /> is a user-defined parameter to control the strength of the diffusion, where a higher value gives more diffusion. The parameter <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\beta" title="\large \beta" /> is not sensitive to the grid spacing, and it seems that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;\beta=0.25" title="\large \beta=0.25" /> is generally enough to get rid of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.latex?\dpi{300}&space;\large&space;2\Delta&space;x" title="\large 2\Delta x" /> noise contamination.

# Checking for Correctness

## Domain-Integrated Mass and Total Energy

There are two main ways to check for correctness. The easiest is to look at the domain-integrated mass and total energy printed out at the end of the simulation.

### Mass Change

In all cases for Fortran and C, the relative mass change printed out should be at machine precision (magnitude `1.e-13` or lower just to be flexible with reduced precision optimizations). If the mass changes more than this, you've introduced a bug.

### Total Energy Change

In order to use total energy to check the answer, you need to set the following parameters:

* `nx_glob`: >= 100
* `nz_glob`: >= 50 and exactly half of `nx_glob`
* `sim_time = 400`
* `data_spec_int = DATA_SPEC_THERMAL`

Also, it is assumed you have not changed any other default parameters such as `xlen` and `zlen`

From there, you can scale up to any problem size or node count you wish. The relative change in total energy should always be negative, and the magnitude should always be less than `4.5e-5`. If the magnitude is larger than this, or if the value is positive, then you have introduced a bug. As you increase the problem size, the energy is always better conserved. These total energy change values are valid for single precision in C++ as well.


## NetCDF Files

Your other option is to create two baseline NetCDF files whose answers you trust: (1) with `-O0` optimizations; and (2) with `-O3` optimizations. Then, you can use the following python script to do a 3-way diff between the two baselines and the refactored code. The refactored diff should be of the same order of magnitude as the baseline compiler optimization diffs. Note that if you run for too long, non-linear chaotic amplification of the initially small differences will eventually be come too large to make for a useful comparison, so try to limit the simulation time to, say, 400 seconds or less.

The reason you have to go to all of this trouble is because of chaotic amplification of initially small differences (the same reason you can't predict weather reliably past a few days). Therefore, you can't compare snapshots to machine precision tolerance.

## nccmp3.py: A simple python-based NetCDF 3-way comparison tool. The purpose of this
## is to show whether files 2 and 3 have more of a difference than files 1 and 2. The
## specific purpose is to compare refactored differences against presumed bit-level
## differences (like -O0 and -O3 compiler flags). This prints the relative 2-norm of
## the absolute differences between files 1 & 2 and files 2 & 3, as well as the ratio
## of the relative 2-norms between the 2-3 comparison and the 1-2 comparison.
